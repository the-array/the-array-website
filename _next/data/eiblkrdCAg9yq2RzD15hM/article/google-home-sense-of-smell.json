For exemple, it might suggest you a new brand of perfume if you happen to stink. Remind you to empty your cat litter box or create reminders to Take out the trash.</p>\n<p>This new capability is made possible by their newly developed olfactory sensor.</p>\n<p>Devices released after may 2015 are already equipped with this capability. An over the air update will soon be released to enable the feature. The company says it will pay customers with older devices to receive the upgrade.</p>\n</body></html>","readingTime":"1 min read","absoluteUrl":"https://therelease.news/article/google-home-sense-of-smell","timestamp":1444734780000,"keywords":"Tag, Another Tag"},"nextArticles":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
