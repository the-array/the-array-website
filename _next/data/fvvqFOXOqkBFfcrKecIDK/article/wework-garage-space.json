Our reporters have uncovered that The We Company&apos;s flagship brand has been eyeing a very specific type of space: home garages. Their property research and acquisition efforts target the Palo Alto suburban area and go back to as early as fall 2019. </p>\n<p>This new project can be linked to Sandeep Mathrani, CEO since February. With his real-estate background, it&apos;s no surprise that Mathrani would have quickly pitched new property categories to tap into during early conversations with the company as part of his hiring process. </p>\n<p>An exclusive leak from WeWork&apos;s head of marketing reveals the thinking behind the operation: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;We want to bring back the narrative of founders starting a company in their garage. Founders today don&apos;t have access to traditional houses, and you can&apos;t replicate that romanticized atmosphere of a hacked-together server room in a 3rd floor loft. It&apos;s just not the same.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Far from the current <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">airspace aesthetic</a></em> we&#x2019;re used to, WeWork&apos;s new spaces intent to &#xAB;fully embrace the creative mess of tech&#x2019;s early days&#xBB;. One interior designer even added: &#xAB;We&#x2019;ve just not been given the budget for it&#xBB;.</p>\n<p>Homeowners of the Valley rejoice! If you can find an alternate spot for your car and Marie-Kondo your Christmas boxes, you just found yourself a potential source of income. According to interviews with property owners who got approached by WeWork representatives, the company seems to be leveraging both pro-bono purchases as well as long term leasing of available square footage.</p>\n</body></html>","readingTime":"2 min read","absoluteUrl":"https://therelease.news/article/wework-garage-space","timestamp":1602587580000,"keywords":"Wework, Garages"},"nextArticles":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
