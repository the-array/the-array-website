Following their [2019 IPO fiasco](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/08/27/wework-is-the-most-ridiculous-ipo-of-2019/#646b9ccb1ad6), commercial real estate giant WeWork faces an urgent need to pivot. Our reporters have uncovered that The We company subdivision has been purchasing a very targeted type of space: home garages. Their property research and offer efforts target the Palo Alto area and can be traced back to as early as fall 2019. 

This new project can be linked to Sandeep Mathrani, CEO since February. With his real-estate background, it's no surprise that Mathrani would have quickly pitched new property categories to tap into in early conversations as part of his hiring process. 

An exclusive leak from WeWork's head of marketing reveals the thinking behind the operation: "We want to bring back the narrative of founders starting a company in their garage. Founders today don't have access to traditional houses, and you can't replicate that romanticized atmosphere of a hacked-together server room in a 3rd floor loft. It's just not the same."

Homeowners of the Valley rejoice! If you can find an alternate spot for your car and Marie-Kondo your Christmas boxes, you just found yourself a potential source of income. According to interviews with property owners who'd been approached by WeWork representatives, the company seems to be leveraging both pro-bono purchase of available space as well as leasing arrangements.
