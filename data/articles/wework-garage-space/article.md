**WeWork explores a nostalgic niche to leave their recent IPO disaster behind.**

Following their [2019 IPO fiasco](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/08/27/wework-is-the-most-ridiculous-ipo-of-2019/#646b9ccb1ad6), commercial real estate giant WeWork faces an urgent need to pivot. Our reporters have uncovered that The We Company's flagship brand has been eyeing a very specific type of space: home garages. Their property research and acquisition efforts target the Palo Alto suburban area and go back to as early as fall 2019. 

This new project can be linked to Sandeep Mathrani, CEO since February. With his real-estate background, it's no surprise that Mathrani would have quickly pitched new property categories to tap into during early conversations with the company as part of his hiring process. 

An exclusive leak from WeWork's head of marketing reveals the thinking behind the operation: 

> "We want to bring back the narrative of founders starting a company in their garage. Founders today don't have access to traditional houses, and you can't replicate that romanticized atmosphere of a hacked-together server room in a 3rd floor loft. It's just not the same."

Far from the current *[airspace aesthetic](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification)* we’re used to, WeWork's new spaces intent to «fully embrace the creative mess of tech’s early days». One interior designer even added: «We’ve just not been given the budget for it».

Homeowners of the Valley rejoice! If you can find an alternate spot for your car and Marie-Kondo your Christmas boxes, you just found yourself a potential source of income. According to interviews with property owners who got approached by WeWork representatives, the company seems to be leveraging both pro-bono purchases as well as long term leasing of available square footage.
