The Californian software company has been taking steps to automate their operations as much as possible. They seem to be keeping their self-driving car advancements on the down low since the 2018 fatal accident. However their new efforts seem to be geared towards getting their fleet of gig-workers ostracized from The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Uber is undergoing the hefty procedure of amending the International Human Rights Law. They claim to want to modify the 72 year old Law in order to preclude their fleet of workers from being recognized as human beings.

Feeling the pressure from the various communities of on-demand workers and their threats of unionizing, Uber has recently shifted gears and turned to the international community.

The reported lobbying activities seem to be targetting the Declaration's Article 23 "(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests." The benefits are clear for the company; no more liability, drivers could be forced to work 80 hour weeks without resistance, no more public apologies.

Another area of focus for them seems to be  Article 6 "Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law."

With lobbyists actively working ont the case in Uber's regional offices' respective parliaments, the company has just officially appealed to the United Nations. Secretary-General of the UN Mr. António Guterres has stated a first reading will be held in the New York City UN headquarters in 2021.
