Uber is undergoing the hefty procedure of amending the International Human Rights Law. They claim to want to modify the 72 year old Law in order to preclude their fleet of workers from being recognized as human beings.

Feeling the pressure from the various communities of on-demand workers and their threats of unionizing, Uber has recently shifted gears and turned to the international community.

After multiple reported lobbying activities in their regional offices' respective parliaments, the company has just officially appealed to the United Nations. Secretary-General of the UN Mr. António Guterres has stated a first reading will be held in the New York City UN headquarters in 2021.
