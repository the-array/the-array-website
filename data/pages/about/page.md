## Headings

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes:

# h1

## h2

### h3

#### h4

##### h5

###### h6

Headings will be automatically converted to Title Case.

## Text

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even add [links](http://google.com)! Links pointing to external website will automatically open in a new tab.

## Quote

If you'd like to quote someone, use the `>` character before the line:

> We want to bring back the narrative of founders starting a company in their garage. Founders today don't have access to traditional houses, and you can't replicate that romanticized atmosphere of a hacked-together server room in a 3rd floor loft. It's just not the same.

## Unordered list

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star `*`
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well `-`
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
