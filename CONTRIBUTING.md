# How To Contribute

## Proposing a Change

Contributions to The Release are made in the form of pull requests.

### Proposing an Article

Anyone with a keyboard and just enough repressed anger about the tech industry can propose an article. Make sure you follow The Release's general [Voice & Tone guidelines](#voice--tone) and have some fun! If you just want to propose an idea without writing an article, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/the-release/the-release.github.io/issues) and add the [![Article Idea](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/the-release/the-release.github.io/Article%20Idea)](https://github.com/the-release/the-release.github.io/labels/Article%20Idea) label to it.

#### Voice & Tone

At The Release, we profoundly believe in freedom of speech and transparency. That is why we have taken the role of the tech industry's truth-seeker. Through slightly [satirical writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire), we uncover tech's dirtiest secrets and make the industry publicly say what's actually going on behind the curtains. We reveal the hidden intentions, we highlight the excess, and trigger readers's critical thinking.

#### Do Your Homework

Are you venturing in a political story? Make sure you use the accurate technical terms, or fictitiously quote the right person. Are you tackling a breaking topic? Do some reading; what are other news outlets saying about it? what has Twitter already surfaced? what seems to be the public's general opinion? BAM. You've just sharpened your angle. 

### Proposing a Fictitious Author

Authors on The Release are fictitious. We believe that the focus should be around the issues highlighted in the articles rather than who wrote them. That's why we decided to go with punny names and [AI-generated portraits](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/). But don't worry if you're looking for that street cred, you will appear as a [Contributor](https://github.com/the-release/the-release.github.io/graphs/contributors) after landing a PR.

You think you've coined Twitter's top trending tech pun? Well you might have what it takes to create a new The Release author.

- Make sure you're not adding another white male
- Get creative with nationalities and different pronounciations
- Don't underestimate the power of a good middlename initialism
- Intend your puns

### Anything else?

We're really open to any other creative ideas to infuse funny and self-deprecating commentary about the tech industry into new formats. Don't hesitate to share your ideas!
