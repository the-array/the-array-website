## Proposing a Change

### Proposing an Article

Anyone with a keyboard and just enough repressed anger about the tech industry can propose an article. Make sure you follow The Release's general [Voice & Tone guidelines](#voice--tone) and have some fun! If you just want to propose an idea without writing an article, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/the-release/the-release.github.io/issues).

#### Voice & Tone

At The Release, we profoundly believe in freedom of speech and transparency. That is why we have taken the role of the tech industry's truth-seeker. Through slightly satirical writing, we uncover tech's dirtiest secrets and make the industry publicly say what's actually going on behind the curtains. We reveal the hidden intentions, we highlight the excess, and trigger readers's critical thinking.

#### Do Your Research

Are you venturing in a political story? Make sure you use the accurate technical terms, or fictitiously quote the right person. Are you tackling a breaking topic? Do some reading; what are other news outlets saying about it? what has Twitter already surfaced? what seems to be the public's general opinion? BAM. You've just sharpened your angle. 

### Do Not Add Yourself as an Author

Authors on The Release are fictitious. We believe that the focus should be around the issues highlighted in the articles rather than who wrote them. That's why we decided to go with punny names and AI-generated portraits. But don't worry if you're looking for that street cred, you will appear as a [Contributor](https://github.com/the-release/the-release.github.io/graphs/contributors) after landing a PR.

### Proposing a Fictitious Author

You think you've coined Twitter's top trending tech pun? Well you might have what it takes to create a new The Release author.

- Make sure you're not adding another white male
- Get creative with nationalities and different pronounciations
- Don't underestimate the power of a good middlename initialism
- Intend your puns

### Proposing a Catchphrase

At The Release, we want to give our contributors a voice. That voice can even be portrayed in our sacred catchphrase. If you have a better idea for "Tech's single source of *truth*", send us your tagline and it'll be a nice little Easter Egg for the  `cmd-R` rage-clicker.

### Easter Egg Ideas

The Release is specifically targetted to the IT crowd. The power-users for whom keyboard shortcuts are *life*. The ones for whom surfing the internet is a never-ending dick-measuring contest where they immediately open Inspect mode to compare the site they're on with their own code's performance. The Apple fanboy who'll open the site on all their devices just to see how good the design looks. The pro-gamer who'll be screenshoting your website on their multi-curved-monitor setup just to tell you it's not scaling properly to their 49" display. You get the picture. These peeps are on the Web for the love of the craft and have on-the-spectrum attention to detail. Top-of-the-line Easter Eggs are the least we can offer them.

#### Fake Ads

Have you always had that idea for a stupid product you think would be *sooo* Jeff Bezos to release? Mock-up a Google AdWords format visual for it!

#### Functional Banners

Have content ideas for our Cookie banner or the Notifications browser pop-up?

#### Hidden Punny Stuff

We're really open to any other creative ideas to infuse funny and self-deprecating commentary about the tech industry into new formats. Don't hesitate to share your ideas!
